### Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Developer from Canada. I have experience building and scaling web applications and services in various verticals. I also enjoy building side projects in my free time.


### Things I'm working on

ExtensionKit is a collection of Chrome Extension starter templates, examples, and development scripts so you can focus on building extensions, not boilerplate.
