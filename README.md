### Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Developer from Canada. I have experience building and scaling web applications and services in various verticals. I also enjoy building side projects in my free time.


### Things I'm working on

#### [AI Dev Roundup Newsletter](https://aidevroundup.com/?ref=github)

Your weekly dose of AI news, tools, and trends for devs short on time, not ambition.

#### [Chrome Extension Mastery: Build Full-Stack Extensions with React & Node.js](https://fullstackextensions.com/?ref=github)

My new premium training course that aims to help you master the art of building production-ready, full-stack Chrome Extensions using modern web technologies and best practices. 

#### [ExtensionKit](https://extensionkit.io/?ref=github)

ExtensionKit is a collection of Chrome Extension starter templates, examples, and development scripts so you can focus on building extensions, not boilerplate.
